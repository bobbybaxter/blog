<p>Iâ€™m a jack-of-all-trades: Army Veteran, English Teacher, Musician, Veteranâ€™s Rep, Screen Printer, Paralegal, etc. My diverse background has helped me learn that Iâ€™m happiest when Iâ€™m able to use both my logical and creative sides as one. Being a developer bridges that gap for me.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve always developed tools at work to automate tasks, collect data, and increase my productivity. I finally started connecting the dots when I realized planning and building these tools satisfied me more than the work itself. Thus, my journey as a developer began.</p>
