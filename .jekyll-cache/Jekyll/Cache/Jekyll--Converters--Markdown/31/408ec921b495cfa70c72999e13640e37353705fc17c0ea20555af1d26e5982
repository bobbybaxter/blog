I"ê<p>After a few false starts, Iâ€™ve finally started this blog to document my projects.  My hope is that Iâ€™ll use this as a reference point and/or brain-dump for my various ideas and side projects.  This blog being the first Iâ€™m documenting.</p>

<p>I initially tried to use CMS.js, but it was just too difficult to customize.  I was looking for a simple lightweight with very little maintenance after setup.  Jekyll/Gihub Pages seems to be my best option.  The setup was pretty simple.  I had to update Ruby on my computer, which I hadnâ€™t touched in years, and I styled the site to look like my Portfolio.  Now, all I need to do is create posts in Github.  Weâ€™re off to a good start.  Now, time to move on to more interesting things.</p>
