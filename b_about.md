### Jack-of-all-trades web developer with a passion for solving problems..

I’m a jack-of-all-trades: Army Veteran, English Teacher, Musician, Veteran's Rep, Screen Printer, Paralegal, etc. My diverse background has helped me learn that I’m happiest when I’m able to use both my logical and creative sides as one. Being a developer bridges that gap for me.

I’ve always developed tools at work to automate tasks, collect data, and increase my productivity. I finally started connecting the dots when I realized planning and building these tools satisfied me more than the work itself. Thus, my journey as a developer began.
